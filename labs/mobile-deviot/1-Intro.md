2. Build an IoT program using a smartphone

## Download and Install the DevIoT app
DevIoT provides the Android and iOS app. You can download the app at [https://bit.do/deviot](https://bit.do/deviot) or [http://mobile.ciscodeviot.com/](http://mobile.ciscodeviot.com/).

### Android
Since this app is not on Play Store, you will download an apk file and install it.

You will need to allow the installation in settings. (Settings > Lock Screen and security > Unknown sources) It can vary accoring to the version of Android or the maker.

As you see, there are two buttons connecting to DevIoT on home: '**SCAN QR CODE**' and '**LOGIN**'.

'**SCAN QR CODE**' button is the way to connect by scanning a QR code. It is explained on the next page '**Connect by scanning a QR code**'. '**LOGIN**' button is the way to connect by inputting data manually, which is described on the third page '**Manually connect**'.
