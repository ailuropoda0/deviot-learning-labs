## Download and Install the DevIoT app
DevIoT provides the Android and iOS app. You can download the app at [https://bit.do/deviot](https://bit.do/deviot) or [http://mobile.ciscodeviot.com/](http://mobile.ciscodeviot.com/).

### Android
Since this app is not on Play Store, you will download an apk file and install it. You will need to allow the installation in settings. You can refer to the following images captured in Android 7.0 "Nougat".

As you see, there are two buttons connecting to DevIoT on home: '**SCAN QR CODE**' and '**LOGIN**'.

'**SCAN QR CODE**' button is the way to connect by scanning a QR code. It is explained on the next page '**Connect by scanning a QR code**'. '**LOGIN**' button is the way to connect by inputting data manually, which is described on the third page '**Manually connect**'.
