# Connect Mobile devices to DevIoT

Completion time: 10 mins


## Objectives
The objective of this lab is to learn how to:
1. Learn how to connect mobile devices to DevIoT
2. Build an IoT program using a smartphone

We learned how to use DevIoT and build your program on DevIoT in the previous learning lab. The program you built was not 100% IoT program. After you finish this learning lab, you can make your IoT program controlling your mobile device.

## Download and Install the DevIoT app
DevIoT offers both Android and iOS app. You can download the app at [https://bit.do/deviot](https://bit.do/deviot) or [https://deviot.cisco.com/mobile/](https://deviot.cisco.com/mobile/). Since DevIoT app is not on public app markets, you need to change a setting. It is explained in the next two pages.
