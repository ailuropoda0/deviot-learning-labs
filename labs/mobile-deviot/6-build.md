You will see the real-time graph as you click the 'Shaker' button on library tab. If there is no graph under 'Description', it means connection between your phone and the DevIoT servor fails.

You can test your shaker sensor by shaking your phone. The 'State' value changes from '00' to '01' when you shake your phone.

### 1. Drag-and-drop components on your project
