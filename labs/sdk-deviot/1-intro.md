# Build your DevIoT gateway using SDK

Completion time: 25 mins


## Objectives
The objective of this lab is to learn how to:
**1**. Learn how to use SDK to build a gateway
**2**. Build an IoT program using SDK

## Prerequisite
From this learning lab, you need to read and write programming code, unlike previous learning labs. Running a sample code doesn't require you to write code, but I recommend you to build your gateway using DevIoT SDK and starter-kit.
This learning lab requires to use **Git** and **Python**. You can learn Git and Python in these learing labs:

 - ***[Intro to Python - Part2](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/intro-python-part2/step/1)***
 - ***[A Brief Introduction to Git](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/lab/git-basic-workflows/step/1)***

## What is SDK?
**SDK (Software Development Kit)** is a collection of software to building application for a specific device or system. With SDK, developers are able to build their programs on the specific system without controlling all details of the system. Android SDK, Mac OS X SDK, and Windows 10 SDK are examples of SDKs.
SDK is a similar concept with **API (Application Programming Interface)**. If you don't know about API, you can skip this paragraph. An SDK usually contains APIs. APIs provide a way to communicate between applications. SDKs are used to make software which communicates with other applications.
**DevIoT** provides the SDK in many languages like Python, Java and Go. Using SDK, you can build gateways to communicate with a DevIoT server. Because there are iOS and Android application for DevIoT, you don't need to build a gateway for mobile phones. However, if you want to connect the IoT devices not running on Android or iOS, it is necessary to build your gateway using SDK.

## What is DevIoT starter-kit?
Most SDKs require developers to code their program. But it is not easy to build a program using SDK from scratch. So DevIoT offers the **starter-kit**, the sample code to build gateways. You don't have to use starter-kit for making your gateway, but you can refer to the starter-kit in order to get accustomed to SDK.
