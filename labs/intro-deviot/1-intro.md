## What is Internet-of-Things?
You might have heard of **Internet-of-Things** or **IoT**. IoT has been the trending technology concept from years ago. IoT is the concept that extends the Internet to any kind of '**things or objects**' which wasn't connected before. So devices like a refrigerator, a TV, and an automobile are connected to the Internet through IoT, sending and receiving data. IoT has an endless amount of potential for being utilized from household to any business. For instance, workers at a plant are able to monitor the status of machinery with IoT sensors in real time and can prevent failure, or handle a problem quickly.

## What is DevIoT?
**DevIoT** is an easy-to-use IoT development environment. It enables frictionless design and deployment by drag-and-drop instead of writing any lines of code (except for some cases using scripts or SDK). You can build your IoT program within a minute. Since it is a web-based environment, you can use DevIoT on the Internet without setting the environment on your local computer.
