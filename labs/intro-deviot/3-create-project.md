### Mode

There are three modes in **Flow View**. Each mode is used for modifying the project.

* **Select mode**: The **default** mode. You can drag-and-drop components in this mode. If there is one Fog component, the connection is automatically generated.
* **Connect mode**: You can connect two components in Connect mode. You can only connect between a Fog component and a non-Fog component. You need to double-click icons to connect them.
* **Delete mode**: You can delete components from the project. Components will be removed by clicking red 'x' buttons.

### Button

* **Tidy up**: 'Tidy up' button arranges all icons on your workspace.
* **Clear**: 'Clear' button is shown only on **Delete mode**. It removes all icons. You can't undo it. BE CAREFUL!
